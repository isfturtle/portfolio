							This was our first assignment using Javascript. It uses only plain javascript; we would learn jQuery the following week. The CSS is done using the bootstrap framework and a custom style.css file. The assignment was to make a "Hangman"-style game with a theme of our choice. As a proud alumna of the UNC marching band, I chose "Songs of the Marching Tarheels" as my theme. An optional "challenge" was given to us to have the game play music upon winning, which I would have loved to have done, but I don't have access to music files for these songs.

							This was our first jQuery assignment. I have to admit I procrastinated on this one, so it's not polished; in fact, it doesn't use any css at all, but I did the whole thing in less than 2 hours, so I'm kind of proud of that.

							This assignment added the use of timing into our skillset. Our assignment was to create a timed trivia game with three questions about a subject of our choice. I of course chose my favorite subject, turtles. The assignment said it was preferable if the user never has to click "next" or "replay," so it loops infinitely, which I'm not sure I like, especially as it's just the same three questions over and over again.

							This assignment was our first using APIs. We were to chose a theme (of course, I chose turtles), and make buttons of search terms within that theme that called the Giffy API with that search term and displayed the resulting gifs. The gifs were to load as stills, and then animate when clicked. There would also be a box where users could add their own search terms. DISCLAIMER: The Giffy API isn't the best, and sometimes comes back with irrelevant or weird gifs; I take no responsibility for these.

							Our first group project! All three us are exotic pet owners, and two of us have repeatedly been given or offered pets that the original owner could no longer take care of. This created motivation to match people with pets they can care for, give them adoption options, and give them information on how to care for their pet. This app gives the user a quiz to match them with good pets of them, shows their top 5 matches, and, when they click a match, shows them pets available for adoption near them, using the PetFinder API. My contributions to the project were processing the data from the quiz to generate matches, keeping quiz answers in local storage so someone won't have to take the whole quiz again if they want to come back and look, and the cute little weather blurb that tells the user what the weather is in their area and why that's a good reason to adopt a pet (we added that because we needed to add another API to fulfill the project requirements)."

							Our second group project. The motivation for this one was to help adults with ADHD or memory problems. It allows users to schedule task reminders to be sent to them via text. We have talked about in the future adding a "check-in/snooze/nag" feature (we each ended up calling it by different names), by which users would continue to recieve text until they confirmed the task had been completed. My contributions to the project were using the Twilio API to send and recieve text messages, and using an npm package called node-schedule to schedule the texts. Feel free to create an account and try out a few reminders, but don't do too many-Twilio is not a free service and I get charged for each message sent."

							Our final group project. One of our group member's boyfirend's mother is an adaptive PE teacher, and has complained about the dificulty of managing the data on her students as her students don't fit into the traditional grade-level system of assessments, and because she works with students across many schools within her county. This app allows her to have all the students' data accessible, to specify goals and objectives for specific students, as well as add custom objectives for students, and keep track of progress on evaluations for individual students on tasks. My contributions were the models for the database-there are seven different documents and they cross-reference each other.
